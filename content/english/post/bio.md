I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Soil and Water [Conservation at Central South University of Forestry and Technology](https://www.csuft.edu.cn).  I consider myself fortunate to be studying in the laboratories of [Prof. Sheng Lu](https://zhxy.csuft.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/stbc/202111/t20211102_121435.html) and [Prof. Lichao Wu](https://zhxy.csuft.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/stbc/202111/t20211102_121444.html).

My research focus lies in **soil nutrition** and **productivity enhancement**, with a particular emphasis on the **evolution of soil phosphorus transformation** and regulatory mechanisms **phosphorus utilization efficiency**.  My research interests encompass **soil phosphorus fractions, soil aggregation properties, microbiological control mechanisms,** and **the response of soil physicochemical properties to plant nutrition.**

Currently, I am involved in two research projects related to soil nutrition and two projects exploring global N2O regulation mechanisms.  I have authored two research papers **as the first author**, which are currently under submission to the *Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrient* and *Biology and Fertility of Soils*.

<font color=red>I am currently in the process of applying for PhD programs for the Fall 2024 term, focusing on soil science and environmental science.  Feel free to reach out to me anytime for academic discussions and collaborations!</font>
