I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Soil and Water Conservation at [Central South University of Forestry & Technology](https://www.csuft.edu.cn).  I consider myself fortunate to be studying in the laboratories of [Prof. Sheng Lu](https://zhxy.csuft.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/stbc/202111/t20211102_121435.html) and [Prof. Lichao Wu](https://zhxy.csuft.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/stbc/202111/t20211102_121444.html).

My research is centered on unraveling the intricacies of the soil nutrition system, particularly with a strong focus on the **dynamic evolution of soil phosphorus** and the **soil nitrogen cycle**.  Within these realms, I emphasize the regulatory mechanisms governing **phosphorus utilization efficiency** and the intricate dynamics of **nitrous oxide emissions**. 

My research interests extend to the study of **soil phosphorus fractions**, **nitrous oxide emissions**, **soil aggregation characteristics**, and the microbial regulatory mechanisms that influence these processes.

Currently, I am involved in two research projects related to soil nutrition and two projects exploring global N2O regulation mechanisms.  I have authored two research papers **as the first author**, which are currently under submission to the *Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrient* and *Catena*.

<font color=red>I am currently in the process of applying for PhD programs for the Fall 2024 term, focusing on soil science and environmental science.  Feel free to reach out to me anytime for academic discussions and collaborations!</font>
