**Project**: *"Change in soil phosphorous distribution and bioavailability within water-stable aggregates under long-term Camellia Oleifera cultivation"*, 2022-2023  
- **Data Visualization with Python:** I employed Python to create bar charts illustrating the distribution of soil aggregates, bioaccumulation factors, phosphorus fractions, and enzyme content across different forest stand ages.  Additionally, I conducted variance analysis using SPSS to scrutinize the results.  
- **Linear Modeling and Langmuir Isotherm Fitting:** I utilized Python to model the linear relationships between soil phosphorus fractions and key physicochemical properties.  Furthermore, I applied the Langmuir equation to assess phosphorus adsorption, calculating adsorption constants (KL) and maximum buffering capacity (MBC).  
- **Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and PLS Path Modeling:** I conducted threshold indicator taxa analysis in R and developed a partial least square path model (PLS-PM) to explore complex relationships within the data.  
- **Microbial Diversity and Correlation Analysis:** Using Chiplot, I analyzed the correlation between microbial diversity, soil phosphorus fractions, and soil physicochemical properties.  Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the strength and direction of these associations.  
- **Conceptual Diagram Construction with Biorender:** I used Biorender to construct and visually represent conceptual diagrams, aiding in the communication of research concepts and findings.  
- **Research Paper Development:** I systematically refined the ideas of paper, corrected errors, and developed logical frameworks, leading to the successful completion of research papers.
