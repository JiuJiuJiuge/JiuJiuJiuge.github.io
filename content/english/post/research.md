**Project**: *"Change in soil phosphorous distribution and bioavailability within water-stable aggregates under long-term Camellia Oleifera cultivation"*, 2022-2023  
- **Data Visualization with Python:** I employed Python to create bar charts illustrating the distribution of soil aggregates, bioaccumulation factors, phosphorus fractions, and enzyme content across different forest stand ages.  Additionally, I conducted variance analysis using SPSS to scrutinize the results.  
- **Linear Modeling and Langmuir Isotherm Fitting:** I utilized Python to model the linear relationships between soil phosphorus fractions and key physicochemical properties.  Furthermore, I applied the Langmuir equation to assess phosphorus adsorption, calculating adsorption constants (K<SUB>L</SUB>) and maximum buffering capacity (MBC).  
- **Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and PLS Path Modeling:** I conducted threshold indicator taxa analysis in R and developed a partial least square path model (PLS-PM) to explore complex relationships within the data.  
- **Microbial Diversity and Correlation Analysis:** Using Chiplot, I analyzed the correlation between microbial diversity, soil phosphorus fractions, and soil physicochemical properties. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the strength and direction of these associations.  
- **Conceptual Diagram Construction with Biorender:** I used Biorender to construct and visually represent conceptual diagrams, aiding in the communication of research concepts and findings.  
- **Research Paper Development:** I systematically refined the ideas of paper, corrected errors, and developed logical frameworks, leading to the successful completion of research papers.

**Project:** *“The stoichiometry of soil trace elements plays a critical role in regulating Camellia Oleifera nutrient accumulation and production”*, 2021-2023  
- **Data Visualization with Origin:** I utilized Origin software to create bar charts, box plots, and conduct principal component analysis for various soil trace elements, enabling a comprehensive examination of their distributions and relationships.  
- **Mantel Test Analysis with R:** Employing the R programming language, I conducted Mantel Test analyses and generated bioaccumulation factor, translocation factor, and C. oleifera yield plots to investigate their correlations with soil trace element content and stoichiometric ratios.  
- **Logical Framework Refinement and Paper Writing:** Throughout the research process, I meticulously refined the logical framework and actively contributed to the preparation of research papers.

**Project:** *“Global nitrous oxide flux emissions in different climate zones”*, 2021-2023  
- **Global Distribution of N<SUB>2</SUB>O Emission Sites:** Using Python, I created visual representations of N<SUB>2</SUB>O emission sites worldwide, illustrating the magnitude of emissions and their correlation with latitude.  These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the spatial distribution of N<SUB>2</SUB>O emissions across different climate zones.  
- **Relationship between Land Use and N<SUB>2</SUB>O Emissions:** Employing Python, I developed graphical representations to examine the relationship between nitrogen fertilizer application across different land use types and N<SUB>2</SUB>ON2O emissions.  These visualizations shed light on the impact of land use decisions on greenhouse gas emissions.  
- **Functional Gene Distribution in Soil Nitrogen Cycling:** Through Python-based analysis, I explored the distribution of key functional genes involved in soil nitrogen cycling across various climate zones.  Additionally, I investigated their correlation with N<SUB>2</SUB>O emissions, contributing to our understanding of the factors influencing soil greenhouse gas dynamics.

**Project:** *“Soil moisture–atmosphere feedback dominates land N<SUB>2</SUB>O nitrification emissions and denitrification reduction”* 2020-2022  
- **Data Extraction from Academic Articles:** Contributed to the screening and extraction of relevant data from 70 out of 907 articles, honing data handling skills and gaining valuable insights into research information retrieval and synthesis.
