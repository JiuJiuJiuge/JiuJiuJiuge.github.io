**Abstract:** Soil phosphorus (P) is characteristic with fractions and effectiveness affecting factors diversity, and extremely restricts plant growth in allitic soil in southern China. The P cycling and the underlying mechanisms under different planting periods remain unclear. A series Camellia oleifera soil samples with different cultivation periods (2, 10, and 40 years) was analyzed to reveal differences in P bioavailability within different soil aggregate particles and identify the main regulatory mechanisms. Results showed that soil pH, phosphorus content and fraction composition, soil organic matter quality and quantity, enzyme activity, and bacteria community composition were significantly different among C. oleifera plants. Microaggregates in the Chi-Per soil (2 years) showed higher phosphorus adsorption capacity than large aggregates, while the opposite trend was observed for the Old-Per soil (40 years). For different kinds of phosphorus fractions, Fe-P (iron-phosphorus) was the most abundant, had the same distribution pattern in the three kinds of aggregate sizes, and presented the same bioavailability of different aggregates. The contents of Ca-P (calcium-phosphorus) and O-P (occluded phosphorus) decreased, and the content of Al-P (aluminum-phosphorus) increased in large aggregates with increasing C. oleifera plantation. Soil AP and different kinds of phosphorus fractions had significant negative correlation with SOM, especially with increasing non-hydrophilic groups. The contents of O-P, Al-P, and Fe-P were positively correlated with soil α-diversity in the large macroaggregate (LM), while it was negatively in the small microaggregate (SM) and microaggregate (Mi). The contents of Al-P, Fe-P, and O-P were mainly correlated with phyla Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi, while that of Ca-P was mainly correlated with Acidobacteria, Patescibacteria, and Proteobacteria. These results revealed that the main mechanism of regulating soil phosphorus bioavailability differed within different C. oleifera plantation periods. The reaction mechanism within different aggregates should be identified to improve the phosphorus bioavailability.

## **1. Introduction**

Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and has the characteristics of low content and bioavailability and extreme deficiency in allitic soil region in southern China (Fu et al., 2020). Soil P presents as organic and inorganic forms and can be absorbed by plants mainly in inorganic form (such as HPO42- and H2PO4–). Factors that regulate P transformation would affect P availability. The quality of soil organic matter would determine the stability of organophosphorus (Vermeiren et al., 2021). Microbial activity and enzyme activity determine organic P decomposition and release inorganic P (DeForest and Moorhead, 2020). Soil mineral composition and metal ion content (such as Ca, Fe, and Al) would bind to inorganic P and reduce mobility (Qaswar et al., 2022). Allitic soil is characterized by high contents of Fe, Al, and secondary clay minerals, high weathering level, and relatively low P availability depending on the balance of many factors (Gérard, 2016). The main reason response for low P availability in allitic soil needs further systematic study.

Camellia oleifera is an economic tree species mainly planted in allitic soil, and its stable harvest period can reach 80 years. The stand periods of forest would affect the aboveground forest biomass, soil organic quality and quantity, and microbial structure and function (Qiao et al., 2021). The P limitation of C. oleifera soil microbial communities significantly increased, accompanied by a decrease in network complexity along the stand age gradient by enzymatic stoichiometry analysis (Qiao, et al., 2021). Soil P content is one of the main factors that restrict C. oleifera production under continuous product harvesting (Liu et al., 2017). The low P utilization efficiency (10%–20%) is the main response of P restriction for plant growth (Liu, et al., 2017, Meyer et al., 2021). Microorganisms are involved in several key biogeochemical processes of P cycling, including P uptake, release, and redistribution, which can increase P availability by more than 20% (Pistocchi et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2021). Acid phosphatase (ACP) activities in soil have been measured to assess the conversion of organic P (Po) into inorganic phosphorus (Pi) because they are considered to play a major role in this process (Tarafdar and Jungk, 1987).

Long-term plant cultivation would accelerate soil weathering and promote the content of secondary clay minerals (Lu et al., 2019). Higher Fe and Al (hydr) oxides and secondary clay minerals would strengthen inorganic phosphorus fixation by forming P-containing minerals (Barrow, 2017, Meyer et al., 2021). Xiong et al. (2022) found that allitic soil has higher content of clay minerals, which provide more P adsorption sites then Fe/Al (hydr)oxides; the P adsorption capacity of clay minerals is more than six times that of Fe/Al (hydr)oxides. Herlihy and McGrath (2007) also demonstrated that soil available P has a high linear correlation with the content of clay mineral. Gérard (2016) demonstrated that clay minerals have more P-binding constituents and play a more important role in P adsorption than Fe/Al (hydr)oxides in over a 70-years period in experimental studies. The influencing factors of phosphorus availability are complex, and the main regulatory mechanism may be different under different C. oleifera planting periods. The main factors and mechanisms of soil phosphorus availability in different growth stages of C. oleifera need to be further studied.

Soil aggregate particle sizes indicate that different ecological niches determine soil organic matter content and composition, soil microbial community composition, and plant nutrient accumulation (Zheng et al., 2018). Different sizes of soil aggregates have different contents of SOM and clay minerals and affect the P adsorption amount and fractions, such as aluminum phosphorus (Al-P), iron phosphorus (Fe-P), and calcium-phosphorus (Ca-P) (He et al., 2021). The forms of P would significantly affect P bioavailability in plants. Cui et al. (2019) found that L-Pi, L-Po, and Re-P tended to decrease with decreasing soil aggregate sizes and Mi-Po was enriched in small aggregates (<0.25 mm). Zhang et al. (2020) researched the correlations between Ptotal and POlsen contents with SOC; they found that P content and fractions were relatively stable in macro-aggregates in long-term plant cultivation, and the increase in soil macro-aggregates can also increase soil phosphorus content and availability. Soil aggregate composition, as an important physical property, is significantly different among different plant cultivation periods, which in turn affect P utilization efficiency. 

Previous study mainly focused on soil P utilization efficiency (PUE) under the control of human intervention, such as mineral fertilization and organic manure application (Zhang et al., 2020). The effect of PUE has been investigated using a single factor, such as SOM, microbial community, or clay mineral properties (Cui, et al., 2019). Systematic study of the evolution of soil phosphorus transformation and PUE regulatory mechanism under natural conditions is of vital importance, and the results would guide the prediction of the biogeochemical process of soil phosphorus. The present work aims to (1) elucidate the redistribution of phosphorus fractions and the P accumulation within different aggregate sizes of C. oleifera; (2) identify the biogeochemical processes and the critical driving factors of P transformation in different aggregates under different plant cultivation periods; and (3) predict the P evolution law of C. oleifera natural soil and propose solutions to improve the PUE.

## **2.Materials and Methods**

### **2.1 Sampling location and experimental design**

The experiment was conducted in Youxian County (27° 03′ 45′′ N, 113° 24′ 31′′ E), Hunan Province, China. The research area has humid subtropical monsoon climate and a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 17.8 °C and 1410 mm, respectively. The experimental site is hilly with a slope of less than 15°. The main type of soil in the C. oleifera field is allitic soil, and the soil texture is clay soil. The background values of soil nutrient are 13.23 g kg-1 SOM, 0.77 g kg-1 total nitrogen, 1.05 g kg-1 phosphorus, and 27.83 g kg-1 potassium. 

The C. oleifera cultivar used in this study was Xianglin No.1, with the largest cultivated area in Hunan Province. Three kinds of C. oleifera forest were chosen, with 2 years, 10 years, and 40 years cultivation, respectively, to investigate soil P transformation and utilization efficiency regulators with plant cultivation periods. The three treatments represent initial stage (Chi-Per), high-yield stage (You-Per), and decline stage (Old-Per). For each planting stage, three standard plots with a size of 20 m×20 m were established and distributed in different parts of the village (Chen et al., 2022). Five soil samples in the top 20 cm soil layer were collected in each standard plot to form a composite sample, and about 1 kg of soil samples were collected in an ice box and transported to the laboratory. The soil was divided into two parts. One part was air dried at room temperature for determination of soil physicochemical properties, and the other part was stored at -80 °C for analysis of microbial properties.

### **2.2 Soil aggregate composition**

Soil aggregate fractionation was determined using dry sieving according to Elliott and Cambardella (1991). Aggregates were mainly divided into three kinds, namely, large macroaggregates (>2 mm; LM), small macroaggregates (0.25–2 mm; SM), and microaggregates (<0.25 mm; Mi). The air-dried soil samples were shaken and passed through 2 and 0.25 mm sieves for 5 min. The soil aggregate samples were sent for analysis of bacterial community composition or soil physicochemical properties.

### 2.3 Phosphorus isothermal adsorption experiment

The P adsorption capacity of different soil aggregate particles were determined. The soil samples were air-dried and passed through 1 mm sieve. About 1.00 g of soil was weighed and placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and added with 25 mL of KH2PO4 solution containing 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, and 75 mg/L P. The solution was added with three drops of chloroform to inhibit microbial activity. The centrifuge tube was sealed and shaken at 200 r/min for 24 h (25 °C and in dark environment) to reach the adsorption equilibrium. The sample was centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 10 min. The phosphorus concentration of the supernatant was measured by SmartChem automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer (WestCo Scientific Instruments, Brookfield, CT, USA). The adsorption amount of soil samples was calculated according to the difference in phosphorus concentration in the solution before and after the equilibrium. The maximal adsorption capacity was fitted with Freundlich or Langmuir equations by using Origin 2022. Each result was the mean of three times of repetition.

### 2.4 Soil P fraction measurement

Soil inorganic P fractions were determined using sequential extraction according to Tiessen and Moir (1993). Soil samples were extracted with the extractants in the following sequences. (1) NH<SUB>4</SUB>Cl-HCl was used for Al-P extraction. (2) The soil samples were then extracted by saturated NaCl solution twice, followed by NaOH for Al-P. (3) The soil samples were continuously extracted with saturated NaCl solution twice. After leaching with Na<SUB>3</SUB>C<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>O<SUB>7</SUB> (sodium citrate), Na<SUB>2</SUB>S<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB> (sodium dithionate), and NaOH (sodium hydroxide), the samples were boiled with H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> and placed in a water bath for occluded P (O-P). (4) The residue was continuously extracted with saturated NaCl solution twice and extracted with 1/2H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> for Ca-P. The supernatants were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and determined by ascorbic acid–molybdenum blue method.

### 2.5 Soil organic matter and functional groups

The functional groups of soil organic matter were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The soil sample was dried at 60 ℃ for 8 h to avoid the interference of the hydroxyl group in the infrared spectrum. Potassium bromide was added to enhance the infrared absorption signal of the samples. The amount of potassium bromide addition with the ratio of 1:100 with soil sample. The potassium bromide crystal (spectral pure) was ground in an agate mortar to particle size of < 2 μm, thoroughly mixed, and placed on the tablet to flatten pressed for 5 min with pressure of 75 kPa. The spectrogram was scanned and measured by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

### 2.6 Soil enzyme activity

Catalase was determined by potassium permanganate titration method. About 5 g of the soil sample was oxidized with 25 mL of 3% H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> and sufficiently reacted in an incubator at 4 ℃ for 30 min. The sample was added with 25 mL of 2 mol/L H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> to terminate the reaction and titrated with 0.02 mol/L potassium permanganate solution.

Sucrase activity was determined by 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid colorimetric method. A total of 5 g of soil was injected with 15 mL of 8% sucrose solution, 5 mL of pH 5.5 phosphoric acid buffer, and five drops of toluene. The mixture was shaken and incubated in an incubator at 37 ℃ for 24 h. About 1 mL of the filtrate was used to suction and reacted with 3 mL of DNS (3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acid). Finally, the sample was diluted to 50 mL with distilled water and colorimetrically detected at 508 nm on a spectrophotometer.

Urease activity was determined by sodium phenol–sodium hypochlorite colorimetric method. About 5 g of the soil sample was added with 1 mL of toluene, 10 mL of 10% urea solution, and 20 mL of pH 6.7 citrate buffer solution and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 hours. About 1 mL of the filtrate was added with 4 mL of sodium phenol solution and 3 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution. The solution was analyzed with spectrophotometer at 578 nm wavelength.

Phosphatase activity was determined by colorimetric method. About 5 g of the soil sample was reacted with 2.5 mL of toluene and 20 mL of 0.5% disodium phenyl phosphate and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 hours. The sample was added with 100 mL of 0.3% aluminum sulfate solution. In brief, 3 mL of the filtrate was reacted with boric acid buffer. The solution was colorimetrically detected at 660 nm on a spectrophotometer.

### 2.7 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing

Soil bacteria community composition was determined by 16S high-throughput sequencing. Soil DNA was extracted by an E.Z.N.A. stool DNA kit (Omega, USA). The RNA was amplified in the V4–V5 region by using primers F(5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and R(5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT-3′). The PCR results were detected using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplicon library was sequenced on a NovaSeq PE250 platform and analyzed using Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and Illumina library quantification kit (Kapa Biosciences, Woburn, MA, USA). The raw reads were filtered with fqtrim (v0.94) to obtain high-quality clean tags. Feature table and feature sequence were obtained using DADA2 after dereplication. Bacteria α-diversity and β-diversity were calculated by normalizing them to the same sequences. The representative sequence was annotated with the SILVA database, and graphs were drawn by R software (R 4.0.2). The raw data were publicly available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession number: SRP332322).

### 2.8 Statistical analysis

All data were statistically analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel (2003) and further processed in SPSS (version 19.0). Differences between treatments were primarily assessed using ANOVA with Tukey test (p < 0.05) for post-hoc comparison. Figures 1–6 were generated using Python 3.9. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the microbial community, which exhibited significant changes in response to variations in environmental variables, were identified. Threshold values were calculated using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) in the "TITAN2" package (Baker and King, 2010). Partial least square path model (PLS-PM) analysis was conducted using the R project.

## **3. Result**

### 3.1 Phosphorus bioaccumulation within different soil water-stable aggregates

Long-term C. oleifera plantations have a significant effect on soil water-stable aggregates composition and the root phosphorus bioaccumulation ability (Fig. 1). The soil water-stable aggregates were mainly composed with 2-0.25 mm particle size (almost 60% percent), followed by >2 mm, and <0.25 mm soil aggregates (Fig. 1a). The P bioaccumulation factor significantly increased with C. oleifera plantation periods in all three kinds of particle size, and especially for the large particle, while it decreased with decreasing particle size (Fig. 1b). The large aggregates had bigger effect on C. oleifera soil nutrient bioavailability than the microaggregates, and the limitation of P became stronger as C. oleifera plantation, especially in large particle sizes.

The cultivation periods were classified as Chi, You, and Old periods. Significant differences among cultivation periods were labeled by different letters (P < 0.05).*

### 3.2 Distribution of phosphorus fractions in soil aggregates

C. oleifera soil was mostly enriched with iron-bound phosphorus (Fe-P) and occluded phosphorus (O-P), followed by calcium-bound phosphorus (Ca-P) and aluminum-bound phosphorus (Al-P) (Fig. 2a). The Fe-P content in the You-Per soil was significantly lower than the two other treatments and with the same distribution pattern in all three kinds of aggregate sizes. The O-P content significantly decreased by 1.2–4.2 mg·kg-1 in the small microaggregate (SM) and Mi, respectively (Fig. 2a). The Al-P was mostly enriched in Mi in the Chi-Per soil with content of more than 18 mg·kg-1, followed by SM in the You-Per soil and finally LM in the Old-Per soil, accounting for 9.47%, 3.84%, and 7.72% of the TP, respectively (Fig. 2b). The O-P, Fe-P, and Al-P for the You-Per soil and Ca-P, Fe-P, and Al-P for the Old-Per soil obtained the biggest descend range in the LM, SM, and Mi aggregates, compared with those in the Chi-Per soil (Fig. 2c).

<img src="\images\article2\Fig2.jpg" alt=None/>  
*Fig. 2 The concentration of soil phosphorus fractions (a), the percentage of each kind of phosphorus to total phosphorus content (b), and variation of phosphorus fractions between different cultivation periods (c) were measured in three kinds of soil aggregates. The phosphorus fractions analyzed encompass aluminum-bound phosphorus (Al-P), iron-bound phosphorus (Fe-P), occluded phosphorus (O-P), and calcium-phosphorus (Ca-P). You/Chi represents the difference between You and Chi, and Old/Chi represents the difference between Old and Chi. Soil aggregate sizes are categorized as follows: LM, large macroaggregate (>2 mm); SM, small microaggregate (2–0.25 mm); and Mi, microaggregate (< 0.25 mm). Statistical significance among the cultivation periods is denoted by different letters (P < 0.05).*

### 3.3 Phosphorus adsorption characteristic of soil aggregates

In the C. oleifera soil, the phosphorus adsorption capacity was significantly different among different plantation periods and soil aggregate sizes (Fig. 3). When the phosphorus adsorption equilibrium was reached, the capacities of phosphorus adsorption in the equilibrium solution followed the order: Old-Per > You-Per > Chi-Per (Tab. S2). The maximal adsorption capacity (Qm) was significantly higher in the Mi size for the Chi-Per sample and in the LM for the Old-Per sample. Compared with the Chi-Per treatments, the Old-Per Qm decreased by 6.21% for the Mi while increased by 9.14% for the LM (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the adsorption constant K and the maximum buffer capacity (MBC) were significantly higher in LM aggregates than in the two other particle sizes for the three plantation periods (Tab. S2).
