**Abstract:** Soil phosphorus (P) is characteristic with fractions and effectiveness affecting factors diversity, and extremely restricts plant growth in allitic soil in southern China. The P cycling and the underlying mechanisms under different planting periods remain unclear. A series Camellia oleifera soil samples with different cultivation periods (2, 10, and 40 years) was analyzed to reveal differences in P bioavailability within different soil aggregate particles and identify the main regulatory mechanisms. Results showed that soil pH, phosphorus content and fraction composition, soil organic matter quality and quantity, enzyme activity, and bacteria community composition were significantly different among C. oleifera plants. Microaggregates in the Chi-Per soil (2 years) showed higher phosphorus adsorption capacity than large aggregates, while the opposite trend was observed for the Old-Per soil (40 years). For different kinds of phosphorus fractions, Fe-P (iron-phosphorus) was the most abundant, had the same distribution pattern in the three kinds of aggregate sizes, and presented the same bioavailability of different aggregates. The contents of Ca-P (calcium-phosphorus) and O-P (occluded phosphorus) decreased, and the content of Al-P (aluminum-phosphorus) increased in large aggregates with increasing C. oleifera plantation. Soil AP and different kinds of phosphorus fractions had significant negative correlation with SOM, especially with increasing non-hydrophilic groups. The contents of O-P, Al-P, and Fe-P were positively correlated with soil Î±-diversity in the large macroaggregate (LM), while it was negatively in the small microaggregate (SM) and microaggregate (Mi). The contents of Al-P, Fe-P, and O-P were mainly correlated with phyla Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi, while that of Ca-P was mainly correlated with Acidobacteria, Patescibacteria, and Proteobacteria. These results revealed that the main mechanism of regulating soil phosphorus bioavailability differed within different C. oleifera plantation periods. The reaction mechanism within different aggregates should be identified to improve the phosphorus bioavailability.
