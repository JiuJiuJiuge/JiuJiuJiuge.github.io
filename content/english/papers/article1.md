**Abstract:**
Understanding the accumulation rule of nutrients is crucial to promote the production of *Camellia Oleifera* . The stoichiometry of soil microelements is more critical than their content in affecting the growth and yield of plants. However, research on *C. Oleifera* in these aspects is limited. In this study, we examined microelement content in soil and various parts of the *C. Oleifera* plant and analysed the relationship between the bioaccumulation, distribution, and production of plant trace elements with the stoichiometry of soil trace elements. Our findings indicated that high-yield plants transported more Ca, Mg, and B to the shoot, while low-yield plants stored higher Fe, Zn, and Al in the root. The significantly lower bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor of B and Mg in the high-yield plants highlighted the importance of nutrient storage in promoting *C. Oleifera* yield. Multiple regression analysis and the Mantel test demonstrated that plant yield and bioaccumulation and transportation of trace elements were more closely correlated with the stoichiometry of trace elements than their content. The significantly different stoichiometry of trace elements in soil of different yields revealed that the stoichiometry of trace elements was more sensitive and reliable in reflecting the balance in soil nutrients of *C. oleifera* and regulating its growth. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the balance in soil trace elements and their relationship with the growth of *C. oleifera* and highlights the critical role of the stoichiometry of soil trace elements in promoting high and stable production of *C. Oleifera*.

<h2><b>1. Introduction</b></h2>

The correlation between soil macro- and microelements and crop yield is well-established, with many studies investigating the optimum nutrient concentration for plant growth (Shtangeeva et al. 2020). Microelements are low in plants but are crucial for plant growth, and both deficiencies and excesses can have adverse effects (Pita-Barbosa et al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2002). Previous studies mainly focused on the stoichiometry of N, P, and K due to their close association with plant growth and neglecting the roles of microelements because the relative low soil content and plant requirements (Xing et al. 2015). Research on soil microelements stoichiometry would offer a comprehensive understanding for the balance of multiple elements in regulating ecological processes (Elser et al. 2010), which is crucial for understanding ‘stoichiometric homeostasis’ and determining the optimal balance of nutrient elements for plant growth.

Most previous studies have concentrated on the relationship between plant yields and soil macro-element contents, such as N, P, and K (Elser et al. 2007, Vitousek et al. 2010), while other physiologically essential mineral elements have been disregarded (Gren and Weih 2012). Trace metal cations, such as Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Al, and B, are critical for plant growth when present at proper value (Lambers et al. 2008), and would cause toxic effects when deviation from the optimal concentration (Krämer and Ute 2010). Understanding stoichiometric homeostasis necessitates considering the balance with other elements in addition to the element content (Gren and Weih 2020, Jeyasingh et al. 2017). According to Penuelas et al. (2010), each species has an optimal microelements concentration and stoichiometry for better performance in its specific ecological niche. The Ca/Al ratio can efficiently mitigate Al toxicity to roots, and the use of Ca in soil solution would limit the access of Al to roots, which in turn reduces Ca uptake in roots (Sverdrup et al. 1992). Mn2+, as a kind of necessary trace elements, would promote plant growth when the concentration ranging from 200 mg kg-1 to 3500 mg kg-1, with the effect depending on plant species and environment (Hodges 2010, Krämer and Ute 2010, Lambers et al. 2015). Plants may also suffered from Mn toxicity when the Fe/Mn ratio is less than 1.5 (Hodges 2010). Ca/Mg ratio is relatively low with value < 1 in the ultramafic soil samples (Rakić et al. 2013, Tomović et al. 2013). Insufficient Mg content would suppress the uptake of Ca because their similar transport systems (Hermans et al. 2013).

Previous studies have examined the correlation between soil microelement stoichiometry balance and plant growth and have revealed that even plants growing in the same soil can accumulate varying amounts of nutrients and trace elements (Guarino et al. 2019, Mišljenović et al. 2018, Neugebauer et al. 2018). To investigate nutrient balance in soil-plant ecological systems, researchers have typically focused on representative tissues, such as foliage and absorptive roots (McCormack et al. 2015). Plant tissues always exhibit different trace elements stoichiometric when soil environment changes (Mo et al. 2015, Sardans et al. 2017, Schreeg et al. 2014), with trace elements content and stoichiometric in roots are more sensitive than in foliage (Huang et al. 2015). For example, the C:N:P stoichiometry of plant roots tends to be more heterogeneous than soil under different field management practices (Sardans et al. 2012). Absorptive roots as the ‘starting point’ are especially important for nutrient and water uptake and can quickly perceive changes in the availability of soil resources. In contrast, foliage, as the ‘terminal point’, the respond may be weak or have a time lag (Schachtman and Goodger 2008, Walter and Schurr 2005). Plant roots are also efficient at removing potentially toxic metals, such as Cu and Zn, through rapid turnover (Guo et al. 2013). Given their significance and potential differential responses, combining foliage with absorptive roots in stoichiometric studies can improve our understanding of the relationship between plant above- and underground parts (Sardans, et al. 2017). 

*Camellia oleifera* is a highly valuable oil plant in southern China with significant nutritional and medical benefits. It is primarily cultivated on laterite parent materials (Liu et al. 2018), where low soil fertility has hindered its production and industry development. To address this issue, understanding the nutrient accumulation pattern of *C. oleifera* is crucial. As a perennial plant, *C. oleifera* has very strict nutrient requirements; excess nutrient supply results in rapid branch and leaf growth but low yields. Proper nutrient supply and balanced elements are essential to increase *C. oleifera* yields. Using enzymatic stoichiometry analysis, Qiao et al. (2021) found that C and P were the primary limiting factors in *C. oleifera* forests. Hu Yuling (2022) found that microelement fertilizers could promote *C. oleifera* yields. Moreover, B and Fe elements greatly influenced fruit yield and numbers, while C and Ca elements could significantly affect spring shoot growth and flower bud differentiation the following year. However, our knowledge remains limited on macro-elemental stoichiometry in soil and its relationship with plant organs.

To better understand the microelement accumulation pattern in *C. oleifera* and provide guidance for appropriate fertilization, we systematically investigated multi-elemental stoichiometry in soil and different *C. oleifera* organs. Field experiments were conducted in the main planting sites using primary cultivars, and nine trace elements concentrations (Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Na, Al, and B) in soil and plants were measured. The study was undertaken to address the questions: (1) Does the stoichiometry of soil trace elements affect the accumulation and distribution of elements in *C. oleifera* organisms? (2) Does the stoichiometry of trace elements more accurately reflect the abundance or shortage of soil nutrients than their content? (3) What is the optimal stoichiometry of trace elements for higher *C. oleifera* yield?

<h2><b>2. Materials and Methods</b></h2>

<h3><b>2.1 Site description</b></h3>

Hunan Province has the largest *C. oleifera* plantation in China, covering an area of more than 1.5 million hectares and distributed across various locations. To investigate the relationship between soil nutrient supply and plant nutrient accumulation and distribution, we selected four sampling sites over Hunan and established long-term research cooperative relationships with local farmers. Four *C. oleifera* plantation bases were chosen, located in the south, north, east, and west of Hunan Province: Shaoyang City (SY) (27°18'59.61"N, 111°40'12.93"E), Changde City (CD) (29°19'52.48"N, 111°45'36.95"E), Yongzhou (YZ) (26°25'32.69"N, 111°31'50.09"E), and Changsha City (CS) (28°30'38.97"N, 112°50'38.22"E). These study sites have a typical humid subtropical monsoon climate, the average annual rainfall and temperature being 1655.5 mm and 18.6 ℃ for YZ, 1361 mm and 17.2 ℃ for CS, 1484.2 mm and 17.5 ℃ for SY, and 1489.9 mm and 17.2 ℃ for CD. The experiment sites are distribute in low hills with characters of altitude less than 300 m and slope less than 15°. The allitic soil in the research region is clay in texture, and low in soil organic matter and total nitrogen, phosphorus contents. Soil samples were collected in November 2021 after harvest. The soil chemical properties of the four sampling sites are shown in Supplemental Table S1. 

<h3><b>2.2 Experimental setup</b></h3>

At each sampling site, *C. oleifera* plants were categorized into high-yield (H) or low-yield (L) groups based on whether their fruit yield was up to 5 kg. Two primary *C. oleifera* cultivars in Hunan Province, Xianglin No. 1 (XL) and Huajing (HJ), were selected for the study. The sampling was conducted in 8–9 years old trees with a planting density of 1200 plants per hectare. Three sample plots, each measuring 20 m ×20 m, were designated for each group (H-XL, L-XL, H-HJ, and L-HJ). Five representative plants were chosen from each plot, and the minimum spacing >3 m. Soil samples from the 0–20 cm layer were collected from four sides of each plant and combined to obtain a composite soil sample. The composite soil sample from the five representative plants was mixed as one sample for subsequent analyses. A total of 12 samples were collected in each sampling site for physical and chemical properties analysed. Details can be found in a previous study (Lu et al. 2022).

Plant root, stem, leaf, and fruit samples were collected from the five representative plants. In brief, the lateral roots with a diameter of 1 cm were selected as the research objective after digging out *C. oleifera* root. Similarly, the stem with a diameter of nearly 2 cm was collected by cutting it off. The fruit and leaf were collected uniformly from all four sides of each plant. All plant samples were placed in a Ziplock bag and returned to the laboratory, where they were dried for 0.5 h at 105 °C to deactivate enzymes and further dried at 70 °C until a constant weight. The samples were ground through a 0.25 mm sieve for microelement analysis. The yield of *C. oleifera* per plant was calculated by weighing all the harvested fruits.

<h3><b>2.3 Soil physiochemical properties</b></h3>

Soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), total potassium (TK), and available potassium (AK) were determined following the method in a previous study (Bao 2000).

To determine trace element content (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, Al, and B) in soil and plant samples, they were digested using H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> and HClO<SUB>4</SUB>. The solution was boiled at 350 ℃ until it was clear and then filtered prior to analysis using standard Agilent inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. All the assays were performed in three replicates.

<h3><b>2.4 Bioconcentration and translocation of the elements</b></h3>

The ability of *C. oleifera* to accumulate trace elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, Al, and B) from soil to the plant biomass was evaluated using the bioaccumulation factor (BAF), while the transfer ability of trace elements to different plant parts was assessed using the translocation factor (TF).

BAF was defined as the ratio of element concentration in the aboveground biomass to that in soil, as the following equation:  

<p><center>BAF=C<SUB>plant</SUB> / C<SUB>soil<SUB></center></p>

where C<SUB>plant</SUB> represents the element concentration in the root, stem, leaf, and fruit, and C<SUB>soil</SUB> mean the trace element concentration of soil.

TF was defined as the ratio of the trace element content in the stem, leaf, and fruit to that in the roots:

<p><center>TF=C<SUB>shoot</SUB> / C<SUB>root<SUB></center></p>

where C<SUB>shoot</SUB> represents the elements concentration in the stem, leaf, and fruit, and C<SUB>root</SUB> mean the trace element concentration of root.

<h3><b>2.5 Multiple linear regression analysis</b></h3>

The relationships between trace element concentration in the fruit and root with the soil trace element content and stoichiometry were determined using a multiple linear regression analysis module in SPSS 20.0 (IBM) software. The regression equations for trace element in the fruit and root were:

<p><center>y=β<SUB>0</SUB>+β<SUB>1</SUB>x<SUB>1</SUB>+β<SUB>2</SUB>x<SUB>2</SUB>+β<SUB>3</SUB>x<SUB>3</SUB>+...+β<SUB>n</SUB>x<SUB>n</center></p>

where β<SUB>0</SUB> is the intercept, β<SUB>n</SUB> is the regression coefficients, x<SUB>n</SUB> is the soil parameter. To ensure the accuracy of the model, soil parameters with a mean VIF<10 were selected as the negative control, and p<0.05 indicated a significant linear correlation between dependent and independent variables.

<h3><b>2.6 Data analysis</b></h3>

All data were statistically analysed using Microsoft Office Excel. ANOVA was conducted to test soil trace elements differences using SPSS 20.0 (IBM, USA). The differences were analysed using the Tukey test (p < 0.05). Origin 2023 was utilized to draw the figures. Principal component analysis was adopted to check the content and stoichiometry distribution of trace elements within different harvest indexes and cultivars. The Mantel test was performed using ‘ggcor’ and ‘ggplot2’ package (R 4.0.2) to reveal the relationship among BAF, TF, and *C. oleifera* yield.

<h2><b>3. Result</b></h2>

<h3 b>3.1 Soil trace element content</h3 b>

Soil trace elements content was significantly affected by the planting sites, *C. oleifera* yield, and cultivars. However, no uniform rules were observed for the distribution of different elements (Fig. 1). The content of Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Na, and B elements in soil exhibited significant variability across different planting sites. The Ca content in soil ranged from 7 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for most samples, except for H-XL and H-HJ in SY plantation site, which had a value of more than 20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. The soil Mg and Mn contents in CD and CS were significantly higher than in YZ and SY, and soil Mg content was significantly higher in high-yield treatment than that of low-yield treatment. The soil Na content was significantly lower in CD and CS than in YZ and SY, and higher Na content was observed in the soil of high-yield plants for most samples. The B content was significantly affected by planting sites. Specifically, it decreased as the latitude increased. The contents of Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn were significantly higher in the soil of high-yield plants in most planting sites (Fig. 1).

Different letters among treatments of each study site indicate significant differences at the p<0.05 level. Error bars are standard errors.*

To better understand the regularity of element distribution, we classified the element content according to plant yield and cultivars. The Mg and B contents (about 27%–34% and 56%–80%, respectively) were higher in the soil of high-yield plants than in low-yield plants (Figs. 2B and 2I). The contents of Fe and Al (around 6% and 4%, respectively) were higher in the soil of cultivar HJ than in cultivar XL (Figs. 2C and 2H). Ca content was lower in the soil of XL than in HJ (Fig. 2A).

We also calculated the stoichiometry of soil trace elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, Al, and B) by the ratio of the concentration of every two elements. We obtained 36 groups of stoichiometry within 9 elements. The results with significant differences within different yields or cultivars are displayed in Figs. 3 and S2. High-yield plants had significantly higher B/Zn and B/Na (Figs. 3H and 3I) and significantly lower Fe/Mg, Mn/Mg, and Al/Mg (Figs. 3C, 3D, and 3E). The cultivar type also affected the stoichiometry of soil trace elements, with HJ soil having significantly higher Fe/Ca and Al/Ca (Figs. 3A and 3B). We also found that Al/Cu and B/Cu were significantly high in the soil of high-yield plants, with opposite results for the low-yield plants (Figs. 3F and 3G).

### **3.2 Plant trace elements content**

The bioaccumulation and distribution of trace elements in plants were determined by analyzing the concentration of trace elements in different parts of *C. oleifera*. Most elements (Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Na, and Al) were mainly stored in the root, followed by the stems (Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, and Na). By contrast, some elements (Ca, Mn, Al, and B) were mainly stored in the leaf (Fig. 4). Comparing trace element content in plants with different yield treatments, we found that high-yield plants transported more Ca, Mg, Fe, and B to the shoot, whereas low-yield plants stored higher Fe, Zn, and Al in the root (Fig. S3).

Different letters among treatments indicate significant differences at the p<0.05-probability level. Error bars are standard errors.*

### **3.3 Bio-accumulation and translocation factor**

The BAF varied significantly among plants with different yields and different cultivars (Fig. 5). Among all parts of *C. oleifera*, the root had the largest BAF value of Mg (6.52%–13.07%), followed by B (6.52%–8.74%) and Na (2.09%–6.61%). However, high-yield plants showed significantly lower BAF values of Mg, B, and Na than low-yield plants (Fig. 5A). *C. oleifera* leaf had the highest BFA value of B (24.42%–246.21%), followed by Ca (6.12%–9.66%) and Mg (4.43%–8.09%). The differences in BAF were mainly attributed to the cultivars, with HJ showing significantly higher BAF values of Ca, Mg, and Na (Fig. 5B). The stem also had significantly higher BAF values of B (13.01%–25.83%), Mg (7.28%–12.93%), and Ca (3.89%–6.25%), and low-yield plants had significantly higher BAF values of B and Al (Fig. 5C). The fruit had significantly higher BAF of B (4.55%–18.39%), Mg (3.57%–6.04%) and Na (1.47%–3.39%). Moreover, BAF varied significantly between high-yield and low-yield plants (Fig. 5D).

Different letters among treatments indicate significant differences at the p<0.05 probability level. Error bars are standard errors.*

The TF also varied significantly among plants with different yields and different cultivars. In *C. oleifera* leaf, the TF of Mn was 6.38%–13.88% in high-yield plants and 19.59%–23.48% in low-yield plants. The TF of Ca was 5.19%–5.75% in high-yield plants and 4.15%–4.63% in low-yield plants. Cultivar HJ exhibited significantly higher TF values of Na and Mg but lower TF of Al than XL (Fig. 6A). In *C. oleifera* stem, high-yield plants exhibited significantly higher TF values of Ca and Fe and lower TF values of Cu and Na, whereas low-yield the HJ plants exhibited significantly higher TF values of Mn and B (Fig. 6B). In *C. oleifera* fruit, TF varied significantly among plant with different yield, as high-yield plants with significantly higher TF of Fe and lower TF of B, Mg, and Cu (Fig. 6C).

### **3.4 The relationship between soil micro-elements and plant physiological indicators**

The Mantel test was used to explore the relationships among soil microelement content and stoichiometry, *C. oleifera* plant yield, BAF, and TF. As shown in Fig. 7, *C. oleifera* yield was significantly correlated with soil Cu content and the stoichiometry of Cu/Ca, Fe/Mg, Cu/Mg, and Al/Zn (p<0.05). It was also highly correlated with the contents of Mn, Mg, Zn, and Al in soil and the stoichiometry of Mn/Fe and Cu/Mn (p<0.01). The TF of micro-elements was highly correlated with the contents of B, Mn, and Na in soil and the stoichiometry of Cu/Mg, Cu/Mn, and B/Na (p<0.01). The BAF of micro-elements was highly correlated with the contents of B, Cu, Al, Na, and Mg in soil and the stoichiometry of Zn/Ca, Cu/Ca, Na/Zn, B/Na, and Al/Na (Fig. 7).

<img src="\images\article1\Fig7.jpg" alt=None/>

***Fig. 7** The relationship between soil trace elements content (A) and stoichiometry (B) with *C. oleifera* plant yield, bio-accumulation factor and translocation factor were analyzed by mantel tests with a color gradient denoting Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Pearson’s r). The color of line denotes the statistical significance based on 9,999 permutations (Mantel’s p), and the line width corresponds to the correlations distance (Mantel’s r).*

Multiple regression analysis can provide a more reliable estimate for the content and stoichiometry of trace elements in soil or plants (Table 1). The R means the dependency level for the regression model, while the adjusted R2 shows the explanatory degree of independent variables to the dependent variables. The results showed that the content of trace elements in *C. oleifera* fruit mostly depended on their content in soil and root. The contents of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Na, Al, and B were dependent on their content in soil; the contents of Mg, Mn, Zn, and B were also dependent on their content in the root (Tables 1 and S2). The dependency of trace element content in *C. oleifera* root on their stoichiometry in soil was also calculated. Only the contents of Fe and Al in the root were significantly dependent on their content in soil, while the contents of Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Na significantly relied on their stoichiometry with other elements (Tables 2 and Table S2).

## **4 Discussion**

### **4.1 Soil trace element contents and stoichiometry**

Based on our results, we found that the content of soil elements was sensitive to changes in altitude (Fig. S2). Specifically, the contents of Mg and Mn in soil increased significantly with altitude, while the contents of Na and B in soil decreased significantly (Fig. 1). Our results also demonstrated that the mobility of Na and B was relatively higher than that of Mg, Mn, and Al. We also observed that the content of elements with high mobility significantly decreased as the altitude increased and the rainfall declined, consistent with the findings of Liu, et al. (2018) in Chinese paddy soil. We also found that regional and climatic differences would hide differences between treatments in the same planting site, and soil trace element content varied across different planting sites or cultivars, with the order of B, Na < Mg, Mn < Ca, Fe and Al (Figs. 1 and 2). These results are consistent with those of Jiang et al. (2018), who highlighted that soil Ca and P were stable while Fe, Al, and Zn were relatively unstable. Lijun et al. found that red soil was rich in Ca, Fe, and Al, which are not the key restricting factors for *C. oleifera* production, even if they differ significantly across planting sites or cultivars (Chen et al. 2022). Our results also demonstrated that the stoichiometry of soil trace elements played a more important role in regulating plant growth than their content, which is consistent with an increasing number of studies (Kou et al. 2018, Li et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020).

We calculated the stoichiometry of trace elements and obtained a total of 36 different stoichiometries of nine elements. Nearly one-third of the stoichiometry exhibited a regular change with different plant yields and cultivars, with high-yield plants having significantly higher B/Zn and B/Na and significantly lower Fe/Mg, Mn/Mg, and Al/Mg (Fig. 3). Only Mg content showed a significant difference between plants with different yields (Fig. 2). The results indicated that the stoichiometry of trace elements was more sensitive in affecting soil fertility than the content of trace elements. Similar findings were also reported by Monaci et al. (2022), who found element content in P. pinaster soil did not exhibit any significant trend, while multi-element stoichiometry was driven by the geochemical heterogeneity of the sites. Wang et al. (2022) also demonstrated that the stoichiometry of soil medium- and microelements exhibited coordinated variation with stand age in Chinese fir plantations. We also proposed regression models to estimate the content of trace elements in *C. oleifera* root based on their content in soil and verified our conclusion using stoichiometry with other elements. Specifically, the bioaccumulation of trace elements in soil relied more on stoichiometry with other elements than the content of trace elements (Table 2). All our findings support our hypothesis that the stoichiometry of trace elements is more sensitive and reliable in reflecting the balance in soil nutrients of *C. oleifera* than their content.

### **4.2 The bioaccumulation and translocation of trace elements in *C. oleifera***

Bioconcentration and TF are indicators for element uptake and utilization (Šinzar-Sekulić et al. 2019). Our results revealed significant differences in BAF and TF among *C. oleifera* with different yields and different *C. oleifera* cultivars (Figs. 5 and 6). Interestingly, we observed that B was the only element with significantly higher BAF in the root, stem, and fruit of the low-yield *C. oleifera* than in the high-yield *C. oleifera* (Fig. 5). This is noteworthy because according to the classification standard of metal elements in China (GB 15618-1995), B content in red soil was extremely low, with a concentration of less than 0.25 mg kg−1, and it is one of the restricting factors for the low yield of *C. oleifera* (Mei 2014). Our study also found that B was mainly stored in leaves of both high-yield and low-yield *C. oleifera* plants, with a slightly higher content in the high-yield plants (46% vs. 41%) (Fig. 4). The high-yield *C. oleifera* had significantly higher B content in the leaf and fruit (Fig. 4). B is essential for flower development and fruit formation, and its deficiency can result in pollen dysplasia, drug atrophy in grapes, and low fruit set (Dong et al. 2016) (Zhou et al. 2017). As *C. oleifera* trees have a low natural pollination fruit setting rate, with less than 30% of flowers turning into fruit, we concluded that B is a key element restricting the yield of *C. oleifera*, and its content in leaves can be used as a key index to evaluate the yield of *C. oleifera*.

Our study also found that *C. oleifera* shoot had higher TF values for Mn, Ca, B, and Na, while n and high-yield plants had significantly higher TF values for Ca and Fe (Fig. 6C). This suggests that high-yield plants transported more Ca, Mg and B to the shoot, while low-yield plants stored more Fe, Zn, and Al in the root (Fig. S3). Ca is an important component of cell walls, while Mn plays a structural role in the lamellar membrane system of chloroplasts. Na can replace K and enhance growth to some extent. These elements are considered structural elements (Tan et al. 2019). Al and Fe are present in high concentrations in red soil and can be toxic when accumulated in high concentrations. Therefore, they are considered ‘toxic’ elements (Du et al. 2016). We also observed preferential resorption of structural trace elements (Ca, Mn, Na, and B) over enzymatic elements (Cu, Mg, and Zn). In addition, toxic elements (Al and Fe) were exuded from other plant organs, such as twigs, stems, and roots (Gren and Weih 2012). Therefore, we concluded that *C. oleifera* transports more nutrient elements (Mn, Ca, and B) to the shoots and discriminates against the uptake of toxic elements (Al and Fe) to maintain a high yield. 

### **4.3 Relationship among soil trace element contents, stoichiometry, and plant uptake**

The Mantel test showed that the soil contents of B, Mg, Mn, Na, and Cu and their stoichiometry were the main factors affecting *C. oleifera* yield, BAF, and TF. Additionally, the stoichiometry of B and Mn with other elements in soil showed a significant correlation with BAF and TF (Fig. 7). These findings further confirmed that B and Mn are crucial soil elements, and the stoichiometry of soil elements play a more important role in regulating soil nutrient uptake and transport, which support our initial hypothesis that soil stoichiometry affects the accumulation and distribution of soil nutrients, in line with a previous study showing stronger stoichiometric responses of nutrient uptake to roots and leaves in tropical forests (Huang, et al. 2015). 

Our regression models revealed that trace element content in fruits primarily correlated with their content in soil or roots, while the accumulation of soil elements in roots was mainly affected by their stoichiometry with other elements (except for Fe and Al). (Tian et al. 2019) also found that P content and stoichiometry with other elements played an important role in determining plant P uptake in P-limited soil. Imbalanced stoichiometry of trace elements, such as Fe, Al, Mn, and Cu, can cause toxicity in plants (Kou, et al. 2018). Consequently, changes in soil element content, especially their stoichiometry with other elements, can significantly promote their uptake and plant growth (Cai et al. 2017).

## **5 Conlusion**

*C. oleifera* is a perennial tree species that exhibits significant variability in yield from year to year, and the accumulation and storage of nutrients play a crucial role in regulating its productivity. Our results indicate that regional and climatic differences are among the primary factor responsible for variations in soil nutrient mobility and efficiency, with an order of B, Na > Mg, Mn > Ca, Fe and Al. Although *C. oleifera* plants with different yields and cultivars exhibit distinct accumulation patterns for trace elements and transport regularity from the soil, elements of high mobility (B, Ca, and Mg) are the primary limiting factors for all plants. High-yield plants transport more Ca, Mg, and B to the shoot, while low-yield plants store higher Fe, Zn, and Al in the root. In particular, B content in leaves can serve as a key indicator for evaluating *C. oleifera* yield. According to the relationship amongst *C. oleifera* yield, trace elements accumulation in roots and fruits, and soil element content and stoichiometry, we found that the stoichiometry of soil trace elements is more sensitive and reliable in reflecting the balance of soil nutrients for *C. oleifera* than their content. Moreover, soil trace element stoichiometry plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth.
