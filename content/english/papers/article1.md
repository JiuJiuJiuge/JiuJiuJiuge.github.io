<p><b>Abstract</b></p>  
<p>Understanding the accumulation rule of nutrients is crucial to promote the production of Camellia Oleifera. The stoichiometry of soil microelements is more critical than their content in affecting the growth and yield of plants. However, research on C. Oleifera in these aspects is limited. In this study, we examined microelement content in soil and various parts of the C. oleifera plant and analysed the relationship between the bioaccumulation, distribution, and production of plant trace elements with the stoichiometry of soil trace elements. Our findings indicated that high-yield plants transported more Ca, Mg, and B to the shoot, while low-yield plants stored higher Fe, Zn, and Al in the root. The significantly lower bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor of B and Mg in the high-yield plants highlighted the importance of nutrient storage in promoting C. Oleifera yield. Multiple regression analysis and the Mantel test demonstrated that plant yield and bioaccumulation and transportation of trace elements were more closely correlated with the stoichiometry of trace elements than their content. The significantly different stoichiometry of trace elements in soil of different yields revealed that the stoichiometry of trace elements was more sensitive and reliable in reflecting the balance in soil nutrients of C. oleifera and regulating its growth. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the balance in soil trace elements and their relationship with the growth of C. oleifera and highlights the critical role of the stoichiometry of soil trace elements in promoting high and stable production of C. Oleifera.</p>

Keywords: Camellia Oleifera, trace elements, stoichiometry, bioaccumulation factor, translocation factor


<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The correlation between soil macro- and microelements and crop yield is well-established, with many studies investigating the optimum nutrient concentration for plant growth (Shtangeeva et al. 2020). Microelements are low in plants but are crucial for plant growth, and both deficiencies and excesses can have adverse effects (Pita-Barbosa et al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2002). Previous studies mainly focused on the stoichiometry of N, P, and K due to their close association with plant growth and neglecting the roles of microelements because the relative low soil content and plant requirements (Xing et al. 2015). Research on soil microelements stoichiometry would offer a comprehensive understanding for the balance of multiple elements in regulating ecological processes (Elser et al. 2010), which is crucial for understanding ‘stoichiometric homeostasis’ and determining the optimal balance of nutrient elements for plant growth.</p>
<p>Most previous studies have concentrated on the relationship between plant yields and soil macro-element contents, such as N, P, and K (Elser et al. 2007, Vitousek et al. 2010), while other physiologically essential mineral elements have been disregarded (Gren and Weih 2012). Trace metal cations, such as Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Al, and B, are critical for plant growth when present at proper value (Lambers et al. 2008), and would cause toxic effects when deviation from the optimal concentration (Krämer and Ute 2010). Understanding stoichiometric homeostasis necessitates considering the balance with other elements in addition to the element content (Gren and Weih 2020, Jeyasingh et al. 2017). According to Penuelas et al. (2010), each species has an optimal microelements concentration and stoichiometry for better performance in its specific ecological niche. The Ca/Al ratio can efficiently mitigate Al toxicity to roots, and the use of Ca in soil solution would limit the access of Al to roots, which in turn reduces Ca uptake in roots (Sverdrup et al. 1992). Mn2+, as a kind of necessary trace elements, would promote plant growth when the concentration ranging from 200 mg kg-1 to 3500 mg kg-1, with the effect depending on plant species and environment (Hodges 2010, Krämer and Ute 2010, Lambers et al. 2015). Plants may also suffered from Mn toxicity when the Fe/Mn ratio is less than 1.5 (Hodges 2010). Ca/Mg ratio is relatively low with value < 1 in the ultramafic soil samples (Rakić et al. 2013, Tomović et al. 2013). Insufficient Mg content would suppress the uptake of Ca because their similar transport systems (Hermans et al. 2013). </p>
<p>Previous studies have examined the correlation between soil microelement stoichiometry balance and plant growth and have revealed that even plants growing in the same soil can accumulate varying amounts of nutrients and trace elements (Guarino et al. 2019, Mišljenović et al. 2018, Neugebauer et al. 2018). To investigate nutrient balance in soil-plant ecological systems, researchers have typically focused on representative tissues, such as foliage and absorptive roots (McCormack et al. 2015). Plant tissues always exhibit different trace elements stoichiometric when soil environment changes (Mo et al. 2015, Sardans et al. 2017, Schreeg et al. 2014), with trace elements content and stoichiometric in roots are more sensitive than in foliage (Huang et al. 2015). For example, the C:N:P stoichiometry of plant roots tends to be more heterogeneous than soil under different field management practices (Sardans et al. 2012). Absorptive roots as the ‘starting point’ are especially important for nutrient and water uptake and can quickly perceive changes in the availability of soil resources. In contrast, foliage, as the ‘terminal point’, the respond may be weak or have a time lag (Schachtman and Goodger 2008, Walter and Schurr 2005). Plant roots are also efficient at removing potentially toxic metals, such as Cu and Zn, through rapid turnover (Guo et al. 2013). Given their significance and potential differential responses, combining foliage with absorptive roots in stoichiometric studies can improve our understanding of the relationship between plant above- and underground parts (Sardans, et al. 2017). </p>
<p>Camellia oleifera is a highly valuable oil plant in southern China with significant nutritional and medical benefits. It is primarily cultivated on laterite parent materials (Liu et al. 2018), where low soil fertility has hindered its production and industry development. To address this issue, understanding the nutrient accumulation pattern of C. oleifera is crucial. As a perennial plant, C. oleifera has very strict nutrient requirements; excess nutrient supply results in rapid branch and leaf growth but low yields. Proper nutrient supply and balanced elements are essential to increase C. oleifera yields. Using enzymatic stoichiometry analysis, Qiao et al. (2021) found that C and P were the primary limiting factors in C. oleifera forests. Hu Yuling (2022) found that microelement fertilizers could promote C. oleifera yields. Moreover, B and Fe elements greatly influenced fruit yield and numbers, while C and Ca elements could significantly affect spring shoot growth and flower bud differentiation the following year. However, our knowledge remains limited on macro-elemental stoichiometry in soil and its relationship with plant organs.</p>
<p>To better understand the microelement accumulation pattern in C. oleifera and provide guidance for appropriate fertilization, we systematically investigated multi-elemental stoichiometry in soil and different C. oleifera organs. Field experiments were conducted in the main planting sites using primary cultivars, and nine trace elements concentrations (Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Na, Al, and B) in soil and plants were measured. The study was undertaken to address the questions: (1) Does the stoichiometry of soil trace elements affect the accumulation and distribution of elements in C. oleifera organisms? (2) Does the stoichiometry of trace elements more accurately reflect the abundance or shortage of soil nutrients than their content? (3) What is the optimal stoichiometry of trace elements for higher C. oleifera yield?</p>
